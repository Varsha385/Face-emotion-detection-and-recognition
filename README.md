Face Emotion Detection and Recognition
This project focuses on real-time face emotion detection and recognition using deep learning and computer vision techniques. By capturing facial expressions through a webcam or camera feed, the system can accurately classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more.

Features
🎥 Real-time emotion detection from live video stream.

🧠 Deep Learning-based model trained on labeled facial emotion datasets.

🖼️ Support for both live camera input and static image testing.

📈 High accuracy with optimized preprocessing and model tuning.

🛠️ Easy to set up and customize.

Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV (for image processing and video capture)

TensorFlow / Keras (for building and training the deep learning model)

NumPy and Matplotlib (for data handling and visualization)

How It Works
The system detects faces in the input frame using Haar Cascades or a DNN-based detector.

The cropped face region is preprocessed (resized, normalized).

The face is fed into a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict the emotion.

The predicted emotion is displayed on the screen in real time.

Applications
